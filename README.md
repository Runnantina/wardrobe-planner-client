# Wardrobe Planner

----
Wardrobe Planner is a tool to help the user filter through their closet by searching through tags to what pre-existing clothing and accessories you might already have within your wardrobe.

Why? Because most of us suffer from dementia when looking for what to wear for any given day, not to mention an event or a big holiday. This way, you can browse through your closet and curate a set of outfits before you start digging into the rabbit hole that is your closet.

2. Save which item(s) you want through the form of a polaroid picture of your item from your closet
3. Save curation as a collection
4. Be able to delete and edit item information and collections.
