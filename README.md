# Wardrobe Planner

----
> Wardrobe Planner is a tool to help search through your closet virtually by use of #tags.

Why? Because most of us suffer from dementia when looking for what to wear at any given day, especially when your life depend on it. This way, you can browse through your closet concurrently with avoiding work and remind yourself what you already have before we give ourselves the excuse to go shopping. This app is supported with a [Rails Backend](https://github.com/Runnantina/wardrobe-planner-api).
